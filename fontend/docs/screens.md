# Screens list for Figma file

Source: https://www.figma.com/design/4RA8ySwaq4YVf3Rv4Je4Lq/Untitled?node-id=0-1&p=f&m=dev
Access: pass: uit123
Language: English (screen names should be kept in English)

Status: Pending exact screen names from the Figma file.

This project cannot access external URLs directly from the CI/editor environment. To complete the list precisely, please either:

1) Grant viewing access and provide the list of top-level Frame names (one per screen), or
2) Export the Figma file’s page/frame structure:
   - In Figma, select the page, then press Ctrl/Cmd + A to select all frames.
   - Ensure each screen is a top-level Frame (artboard).
   - Copy the names from the left Layers panel, or
   - File → Export → select JSON (via a plugin like “Figma to JSON”) and share here, or
   - Send screenshots of the left panel showing Pages and Frame names.

Once we have the names, paste them below. The structure we will use:

- Splash
- Onboarding 1
- Onboarding 2
- Login
- Sign Up
- Forgot Password
- OTP Verification
- Home
- Workout Details
- Coach Details
- Search
- Notifications
- Profile
- Edit Profile
- Settings
- ... (append as needed based on the Figma file)

If you prefer, you can edit this file directly and commit the exact list. We will keep this file as the single source of truth for screens referenced by the app.
